This site is supposed to be more my computer-related page on the web. I have struggled for quite some to time to decide if I want such a place; for now this acts more like a placeholder.

I am a software engineer by day, photographer by night and traveller on the weekend! And I usually struggle dividing my time among these. Travelling is my way of broadening my way of thinking and my point of view; plus it’s a way to escape from computers (of which both soft. eng. and photography have a lot).

I have graduated from Athens College (HAEF) high school, and I’m currently an undergraduate student in IT at Technological Educational Institute of Larissa. Right now I am working full-time as a software engineer. I have experience working both on-location and remotely, and I like working with people sharing the same fields of knowledge and interest. It is a vital part of my exelixis continuously expanding my knowledge and adopting new technologies. My professional interests are software engineering and algorithm design. I enjoy both designing new software from scratch and adopting and modifying existing to meet advanced requirements.

I currently reside in Athens, Greece.
